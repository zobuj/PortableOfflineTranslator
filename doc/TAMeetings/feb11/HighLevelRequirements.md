# RSPCM Software Infastructure

- We need to start to build a software program that will orchastrate the pipeline of data through various ML models that will perform transcription, translation, and speech synthesis. This will also need to support listening to the microcontroller port to decide when it should start to process data. 

- We will need to start with a general implenentation of this data pipeline where we can initally use APIs to query models. Once we get this to work, we can figure out exactly how much memory and storage we will require from these models to determine if we need to do some quantization or add more storage space. This is to be able to have the models on board and queryable offline.
